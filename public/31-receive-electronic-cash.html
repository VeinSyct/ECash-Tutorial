<br>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Display user's (beneficiary is you) electronic cash address QR code onto the device screen for the benefactor to scan.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>After the benefactor acquires the beneficiary's electronic cash address, the benefactor can specify the currency and the amount of electronic cash to transfer to you. A transfer QR code will then appear on the benefactor's device screen for you to scan. Scan the code until a confirmation dialog appears, indicating that the electronic cash transfer has been successful.</p>
