<h1>Tutorials - Receive Electronic Cash</h1>
<p>To receive electronic cash, a sender must transfer it to your electronic cash address. You can share your address using a QR code displayed on your device screen.</p>
<br>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Display your electronic cash address QR code on your device for the benefactor to scan.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>After the benefactor acquires your electronic cash address via QR code, they can specify the amount of electronic cash to transfer to you. A transfer QR code will then appear on the benefactor's device screen for you to scan. Scan the code until a confirmation dialog appears, indicating that the electronic cash transfer has been successful.</p>
